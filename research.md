**On the Optimal Design of Consumption Taxes** (Draft available upon request)\
    -  *EUI Best Second Year Paper Award*\
    - Presented at: *EUI 2nd Year Forum (2022), Swiss Economists Abroad End of the Year Conference 2022, EUI Macro Working Group (2023), SAEe 2023*

    *How should differentiated consumption taxes be designed in the presence of capital income taxes and progressive labor income taxes?
I study this question using a quantitative model featuring heterogeneous households with non-homothetic preferences, uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, and a government that uses various tax instruments to raise revenue. I estimate the parameters governing households' demand using data from the US Consumption Expenditure Survey, and show that my model matches the heterogeneous consumption behavior across the income distribution. Allowing the benevolent government to jointly optimize consumption taxes on 11 different consumption categories and labor income taxes, I find that necessities should be heavily subsidized (-50%), that luxuries are optimally taxed at a positive rate (12%), and that the level of the labor income tax is increased while its progressivity remains largely unchanged from the status quo. Three main mechanisms explain why such differentiated tax rates are welfare maximizing: they reduce consumption inequality by subsidizing essential goods of low-income households, imply a targeted taxation of the initial wealth of high-wealth households, and induce highly productive households to increase their labor supply.*
