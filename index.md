My name is Michael Barczay and I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.

I am working under the supervision of [Alexander Monge-Naranjo](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=alexander-monge-naranjo) and [Russell Cooper](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=russell-cooper).

My research focuses on topics related to **(Quantitative) Macroeconomics** and **Public Finance**.
